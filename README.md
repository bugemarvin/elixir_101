Elixir files end with `.ex` as it's representation

so to create a file we simply end the it with a `.ex`.\
see below:
```
touch am_a_file.ex
```

## Basic data types

```
iex> 1          # integer
iex> 0x1F       # integer
iex> 1.0        # float
iex> true       # boolean
iex> :atom      # atom / symbol
iex> "elixir"   # string
iex> [1, 2, 3]  # list
iex> {1, 2, 3}  # tuple
```
